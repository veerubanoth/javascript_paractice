//~! Declare a variable with var or the let and const keword
let Name; // variable declared.
Name = "veeru"; // Define the variable and assign the value.

let user = "veeru",// Define multiple variables inn this multiline style.
  age = "32",
  newMessage = "Hello";


//~> We can also changge it as many times as we want.
let message;
    message = 'Hello!';
    message = 'World';// value changed.
// When the value is changed, the old data is removied from the variable.
// Variable should be declared only once.
// A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error.
// so, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without let.

//* Variable naming 
// The name must contain only letters, or the symbols $ and _
// The first character must not be adigit.
let userName; //camelCase is commonly used.
let test123;
let $ = 1;
let _ = 2;
// let 1a; // can't start with a digit
// let my-name; //hyphes aren't allowed in the name
